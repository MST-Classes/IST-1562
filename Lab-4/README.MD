# Lab 4 - Recursion 2


### Count the digits
Prompt user to enter a positive integer. Write a recursive method called digitCount() that takes the positive integer as a parameter and returns the number of digits in the integer.

Hint: The number of digits increases by 1 whenever the input number is divided by 10.



Ex: If the input is:
`3456`

The method digitCount() returns and the program outputs:
`4`
