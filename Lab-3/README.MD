# Lab 3 - Recursion

### Calculating using recursion

1. A recursive method is one that invokes itself directly or indirectly. Please write a program that prompts the user to enter one positive integer (a) and one nonnegative integer (b), and displays the result of a^b.


2. This recursive method must include a base case. A recursive call can result in many more recursive calls because the method keeps on dividing a subproblem into new subproblems. For a recursive method to terminate, the problem must eventually be reduced to a stopping condition (base case).


3. This recursive method must include a recursive call. The subproblem is essentially the same as the original problem, but it is simpler or smaller. Because the subproblem has the same property as the original problem you can call the method with a different argument, which is referred to as a recursive call (recursion rule).


4. The method to submit your assignment.
