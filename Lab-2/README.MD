# Lab 2 - Sort

### Implement a Sorting Algorithm to Sort Arrays.

1. Create a method to implement an O(n^2) sorting algorithm. For example, you can use selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, or any other ordinary sorting algorithm.

2. Test your method by sorting two arrays with the method you just created (Don't use the Arrays.sort method).

3. Check the result by printing all the elements of the sorted arrays in the main method.


Example 1:
```
    Input: {10, 2, 5, -2, 8, 1, 9}

    Output: -2 1 2 5 8 9 10

```
Example 2:
```
    Input: {-33, 78, 0, -2, 8, 1, -45}

    Output: -45 -33 -2 0 1 8 78
```

4. The method to submit your assignment.

    Submit a .java file.
