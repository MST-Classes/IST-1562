# Lab 10 - Palindromes

Checking Palindromes

Please write a method that checks whether a string is a palindrome.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. The word "mom", "dad", and "noon", for instance, are all palindromes.

The problem is to write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and call the method checkPalindrome to report whether the string is a palindrome.



Hint: One solution is to check whether the first character in the string is the same as the last character. If so, check whether the second character is the same as the second-to-last character. This process continues until a mismatch is found or all the characters in the string are checked, except for the middle character if the string has an odd number of characters.
